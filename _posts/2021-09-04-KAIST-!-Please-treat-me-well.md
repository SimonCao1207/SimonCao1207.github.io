I have just spent my first week in Korea. Finally, I can sit and walk on the soft grass of KAIST campus in a nice sunny day. Eventhough I'm not anymore a freshman, everything seems so fresh and new. Covid pandamic have surely affected everyone's life and I'm not any exception. I have to spend my first year of college without much of experience that a normal university student should have had. Now I finally come to KAIST and I'm ready to face any challenge that might be foolish enough to face me.
