_My 2nd semester at Kaist have just ended. Therefore, I have some free time to practice more on my areas of interest like data science, web, algorithms and data structure. In this post, I create 3 sections, each wih a list of set up goals that I hope to accomplish during 2-month period of summer break._

**1. <ins>Machine learning and data science</ins>**

- Project on [kaggle](https://kaggle.com):
  - Image segmentation with pytorch using [Carvana dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge). This is related to the final project I have done in my recent course at KAIST _CoE202: Basics to AI_
- Book about [introduction to machine learning interviews](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/contents/1.1.1-working-in-research-vs.-workingin-production.html).
  <br>This book was writen by a Vietnamese author [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/). She's a Stanford professor and is known as a famous fiction book writer in Vietnam.<br>

**2. <ins>Learning basic html, css and java script</ins>**

**3. <ins>Algorithms and data structures practice</ins>**

- [binarysearch](https://binarysearch.com/)
- [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
