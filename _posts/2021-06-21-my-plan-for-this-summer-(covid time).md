_My 2nd semester at Kaist have just ended. Therefore, I have some free time to practice more on my areas of interest like data science, web, algorithms and data structure. In this post, I create 3 sections, each wih a list of set up goals that I hope to accomplish during 2-month period of summer break._

**1. <ins>Deep learning and data science</ins>**

- Project on [kaggle](https://kaggle.com):
  - Image segmentation with pytorch using [Carvana dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge). This is related to the final project I have done in my recent course at KAIST _CoE202: Basics to AI_
