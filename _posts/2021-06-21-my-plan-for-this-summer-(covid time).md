_My 2nd semester at Kaist have just ended. Therefore, I have some free time to practice more on my areas of interest like data science, web, algorithms and data structure. In this post, I create 3 sections, each wih a list of set up goals that I hope to accomplish during 2-month period of summer break._

**1. <ins>Machine learning and data science</ins>**

- Project on [kaggle](https://kaggle.com):
  - Image segmentation with pytorch using [Carvana dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge). This is related to the final project I have done in my recent course at KAIST _CoE202: Basics to AI_
- Book about [introduction to machine learning interviews](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/contents/1.1.1-working-in-research-vs.-workingin-production.html).
  <br>This book was writen by a Vietnamese author [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/). She's a Stanford professor and is known as a famous fiction book writer in Vietnam.<br>

- Support Vector Machine:

**2. <ins>Learning basic html, css and java script</ins>**

I learned nothing unfortunately. Just some basic html is simply not enough.

**3. <ins>Algorithms and data structures practice</ins>**

- I create a GUI project [here](https://github.com/SimonCao1207/Maze-Solving) called `Maze Solving` to practice with implementing path finding algorithms like `dfs`, `bfs`, `A*`.
- [binarysearch](https://binarysearch.com/)
- [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

**4. <ins>Learning java from scartch</ins>**
<br>I am learning `Java` from scratch.
I know this going to be a boring journey since I have to get used to the syntax, printing format, etc...<br>
<br>I will try to solve at least 10 challenges with `java` on hackerank to catch up with the most basic parts of this language. <br>

<ins>_Update_</ins>: I ended up doing nothing. Sadge.
