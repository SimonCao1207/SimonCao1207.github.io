When the weekend came around, I would sit on my bed contemplating everything I should be doing.  I had developed [akrasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia), which is worse than procrastination because you aren’t really relaxing because your mind is occupied by the things you should be doing.    

And that became my quest: to be productive all the time, not just right before the deadline.

One of the reasons I was so productive was I had extrinsic motivation. It is really hard to get things done if you aren’t motivated to do the work. Therefore the first part of any task is to figure out the why behind it.  What is the inspiration behind it? Some work (like writing this blog post) you may do because of intrinsic motivation; you enjoy the process. 

Once you know why you are doing the work, then you need to understand why you aren’t doing the work.

The key to being productive is to have a plan. The first part of a plan is getting started.  And getting started means dealing with your mind and emotions.
