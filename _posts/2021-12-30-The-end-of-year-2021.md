This is it. The end of 2021 - A year with so much expectations ends up full of suprising moments and disappointing ones at the same time. Yet another year has gone by.

This is a perfect time for me to sit down writting and looking back at the whole year journey. Honestly, I have gone through so much ups and downs this semester more than any other previous ones I have experienced.

I met new friends. We lived together, studied, had lunch and dinner together. Each person seems to have their unique character that I can only tell after spending so much time with them. I felt that one month living and studying together was enough for us to know each other way better than a year of getting in touch through the screen of a souless computer. Real life conversations is precious more than ever especially in this Covid era. I love to listen to others's stories when walking with them along the way home after lunch time in a beautiful sunny afternoon. I love to spend time with friends in an intense board game discussing tactics or singing along to some background musics and sometimes laughing about something funny suddenly came through our mind. If it were not for those moments, I could not imagine how I handle the stress coming from tons of assignments and homeworks that I had to dealt with every week.
