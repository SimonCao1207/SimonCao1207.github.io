<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    I am <b>Hai Nam</b>, currently a senior student pursuing B.Sc. in Computer Science at KAIST. I will be graduating next June.
</p>
<p>
    I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in other fields as well especially machine learning and deep learning.
</p>
<p>
    I love playing sports especially football and badminton. I am also the organizer of a Vietnamese badminton club at KAIST. We play badminton every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday ! I play guitar as a hobby as well, although I can't claim to be too good.
